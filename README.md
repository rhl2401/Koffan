## What does "Koffan" mean?

Pronounced **KOF-fan** (rhymes with "coffin" but with an "a" at the end). The name comes from the Polish word *"kochanie"* (meaning "darling" or "sweetheart"), which evolved into a playful nickname. It's a long story, but let's just say the name stuck! :D

## What is Koffan?

Koffan is a lightweight web application for managing shopping lists, designed for couples and families. It allows real-time synchronization between multiple devices, so everyone knows what to buy and what's already in the cart.

The app works in any browser on both mobile and desktop. Just one password to log in - no complicated registration required.

## Why did I build this?

I needed an app that would let me and my wife create a shopping list together and do grocery shopping quickly and efficiently. I tested various solutions, but none of them were simple and fast enough.

I built the first version in **Next.js**, but it turned out to be very resource-heavy. I have a lot of other things running on my server, so I decided to optimize. I rewrote the app in **Go** and now it uses only **~2.5 MB RAM** instead of hundreds of megabytes!

## Features

- **Ultra-lightweight** - ~16 MB on disk, ~2.5 MB RAM
- **Multiple lists** - Create separate lists for different stores or purposes, with custom icons
- **PWA** - Install on your phone like a native app
- **Offline mode** - Add, edit, check/uncheck products without internet (auto-sync when back online)
- **Auto-completion** - Fuzzy search suggestions from your history, remembers sections
- Organize products into sections (e.g., Dairy, Vegetables, Cleaning)
- Mark products as purchased
- Mark products as "uncertain" (can't find it in the store)
- Real-time synchronization (WebSocket)
- Responsive interface (mobile-first)
- **Dark mode** - Automatic theme based on system preferences
- Multi-language support (PL, EN, DE, ES, FR, PT, UK, NO, LT, EL, SK, SV, RU)
- Simple login system
- Rate limiting protection against brute-force attacks
- **REST API** - Programmatic access for integrations and migrations ([docs](https://github.com/PanSalut/Koffan/wiki/REST-API))

## Tech Stack

- **Backend:** Go 1.21 + Fiber
- **Frontend:** HTMX + Alpine.js + Tailwind CSS
- **Database:** SQLite

## Local Setup (without Docker)

You can run Koffan directly on your machine using Go. This works on any system (macOS, Linux, Windows).

### 1. Install Go

**macOS (Homebrew):**
```bash
brew install go
```

**Linux (Debian/Ubuntu):**
```bash
sudo apt install golang-go
```

**Windows:**
Download from [go.dev/dl](https://go.dev/dl/)

### 2. Clone and Run

```bash
git clone https://github.com/PanSalut/Koffan.git
cd Koffan
go run main.go
```

App available at http://localhost:3000

Default password: `shopping123`

To set a custom password:
```bash
APP_PASSWORD=yourpassword go run main.go
```

## Docker

> **Upgrading from 2.9.x or earlier?** The default container port changed from `80` to `8080` in 2.10.0 so the image can run as a non-root user. If you are upgrading, update your port mappings and any reverse proxy upstreams accordingly:
>
> - `docker run -p 80:80` → `docker run -p 80:8080`
> - `docker run -p 3000:80` → `docker run -p 3000:8080`
> - Reverse proxies (nginx / Caddy / Traefik): point the upstream to the container's port `8080`
> - If you previously overrode `PORT` via env to work around the privileged port, you can drop that override
>
> Coolify and other auto-discovery setups that read the image's `EXPOSE` will pick up the new port on redeploy without any manual change.

### Quick Start (recommended)

```bash
docker run -d -p 3000:8080 -e APP_PASSWORD=yourpassword -v koffan-data:/data ghcr.io/pansalut/koffan:latest
```

App available at http://localhost:3000

### Build from source

```bash
docker-compose up -d
# App available at http://localhost:8080
```

3. Add your app's URL to **Authorized redirect URIs**: `https://your-domain/auth/google/callback`
4. Set the environment variables:
   ```
   GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your-client-id.apps.googleusercontent.com
   GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your-client-secret
   ```

### Microsoft / Entra

1. Go to [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/) → **Microsoft Entra ID** → **App registrations** → **New registration**.
2. Under **Redirect URIs**, add: `https://your-domain/auth/microsoft/callback`
3. Create a **Client secret** under **Certificates & secrets**.
4. Set the environment variables:
   ```
   MICROSOFT_CLIENT_ID=your-application-client-id
   MICROSOFT_CLIENT_SECRET=your-client-secret
   MICROSOFT_TENANT=common   # or your specific tenant ID to restrict to one org
   ```

### PocketID

1. In your PocketID admin panel, create a new **OIDC Client**.
2. Set the redirect URI to: `https://your-domain/auth/pocketid/callback`
3. Set the environment variables:
   ```
   POCKETID_URL=https://id.your-domain.com
   POCKETID_CLIENT_ID=your-client-id
   POCKETID_CLIENT_SECRET=your-client-secret
   ```

## Deploy to Your Server

### Docker

```

### Coolify

1. Add new resource → **Docker Compose** → Select your Git repository or use `https://github.com/PanSalut/Koffan`
